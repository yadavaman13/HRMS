## 1. Document Catalog & Agent Dispatch Guidelines

Use this section to determine exactly which reference document is required based on your current task or query.

### 📂 File 1: [Server Architecture Guide](server-architecture.md)

- **Filename:** `server-architecture.md`
- **Core Purpose:** Provides the high-level master architectural blueprint of the backend application, serving as the baseline entry point.
- **Key Contents:**
  - System overview and global technology stack specifications.
  - Complete server directory map and module descriptions.
  - Full ER diagram and basic Drizzle schema fields.
  - Sequence flow diagrams for key flows (Auth, AI Streaming, RAG Ingestion, Razorpay).
  - Global error handling and middleware execution hierarchy.
  - Mini-blueprints for database additions, DAOs, modular controller/routes, and cron jobs.
- **🤖 When to Use (Agent Instructions):**
  - Read this file **first** during session onboarding to build a mental model of the codebase layout.
  - Consult this file when designing a feature spanning multiple layers (e.g., an Express module containing schema, routing, services, and middlewares).
  - Refer to this file to understand global configurations (caching, rate-limiting, error handling, SMTP mail dispatchers).

### 📂 File 2: [Auth Module Routing Reference Guide](auth-routes-guide.md)

- **Filename:** `auth-routes-guide.md`
- **Core Purpose:** A deep dive into the authentication, authorization, admin, and user profile management endpoint routes.
- **Key Contents:**
  - Master routing summary table detailing endpoints, HTTP methods, access levels, validators, parameters, and return payloads.
  - Detailed route specifications and execution flows (such as signup, OTP caching in Redis, soft-delete recovery bounds).
  - Step-by-step blueprints for implementing validation rule arrays and mounting Express routing pipelines.
- **🤖 When to Use (Agent Instructions):**
  - Consult this file before modifying or creating authentication routes under `/api/auth`, user profile routes under `/api/users`, or admin routes under `/api/admin`.
  - Refer to this file when auditing input validation checks (`express-validator`), rate-limits, or RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) restrictions.
  - Read this file to modify account lifecycle states (registration, OTP verification, recovery, password reset flows).

### 📂 File 3: [PostgreSQL Database & Drizzle ORM Manual](pg-db.md)

- **Filename:** `pg-db.md`
- **Core Purpose:** Complete guide dedicated to database schemas, relational designs, migration pipelines, and queries.
- **Key Contents:**
  - Pool and Drizzle connection lifecycle flowcharts.
  - Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) mapping users, chats, messages, files, RAG files, chunks, and payments.
  - Detailed column specifications, indices, primary/foreign keys, and cascade deletion properties for every table.
  - Step-by-step developer guidelines on writing Drizzle schemas, registering tables, generating/applying migrations, writing DAOs, and database seeding.
- **🤖 When to Use (Agent Instructions):**
  - Consult this file before writing database schemas, updating column definitions, or running Drizzle-Kit CLI migration operations.
  - Read this file to implement the **Data Access Object (DAO)** pattern for raw query queries.
  - Refer to this file when troubleshooting database connection pools, transaction boundaries, index optimizations, or table cascading behaviors.

### 📂 File 4: [HTML-to-PDF Service Architecture Guide](pdf-service-guide.md)

- **Filename:** `pdf-service-guide.md`
- **Core Purpose:** Specialized manual for the lightweight, chromium-free PDF generation engine (`makePDF`).
- **Key Contents:**
  - Rendering pipeline layout (`Data -> Template -> makePDF -> html-pdf-lite -> PDF Buffer`).
  - CSS and HTML markup styling compatibility guides (supported borders, flexbox limitations, page-break variables).
  - Font registration guides (registering custom TTF/OTF fonts in the canvas renderer).
  - Client download helper implementations (`pdfDownload.js`).
  - Detailed blueprints for creating templates and testing visual styles.
- **🤖 When to Use (Agent Instructions):**
  - Consult this file before designing a new HTML template (e.g., invoices, receipts, reports) destined for rendering.
  - Read this file to debug rendering issues, layout breaks, page-overflow bugs, or custom font issues.
  - Refer to this file to set up inline rendering, file downloads, or PDF attachment dispatch functions.

### 📂 File 5: [Server Implementation Reference Guide](implementation_server.md)

- **Filename:** `implementation_server.md` (located in this directory)
- **Core Purpose:** Acts as the live record of implemented backend features, API contracts, routing definitions, database schemas, edge cases, and core business logic.
- **🤖 When to Use & Maintenance Rules (Agent Instructions):**
  - **SCAN FIRST:** You **MUST** scan the entire [`implementation_server.md`](implementation_server.md) file before writing or modifying any backend code to check if that information or route already exists.
  - **AVOID REDUNDANCY:** If an endpoint or feature is already defined, do not create duplicate logic or conflicting routes.
  - **KEEP IT UPDATED:** Based on each new feature development or enhancement, you **MUST** update this file so that it keeps on updating along with the codebase. Add details of the new API contracts, routings, description, schemas involved, edge cases, and business logic involved.
  - **ENHANCE EXISTING:** If your task modifies/extends an existing feature, append/enhance its section in [`implementation_server.md`](implementation_server.md) accordingly.

## 3. Core Architectural Rules (Cheat Sheet)

Human developers and AI agents must adhere to the following coding conventions established in the guidelines:

1.  **Strict Layer Separation:**
    - **Routes:** Define URLs, call middlewares, apply validator arrays, and mount controller handlers.
    - **Validators:** Use `express-validator` to validate and sanitize incoming payloads before controller execution.
    - **Controllers:** Parse requests, invoke DAOs/services, wrap executions in `try/catch(next)` blocks, and return responses using [`response.utils.js`](../../server/src/utils/response.utlis.js).
    - **DAOs (Data Access Objects):** Execute Drizzle queries (`db.select()`, `db.insert()`, etc.) against PostgreSQL tables. **Controllers must not access the Drizzle database object `db` directly.**
2.  **PDF Safety:**
    - Always validate HTML parameters using template functions.
    - Wrap variables inside template functions in `escapeHtml()`.
    - Ensure all CSS properties used inside templates match supported styles outlined in [`pdf-service-guide.md`](pdf-service-guide.md).
3.  **Testing & Visual Regressions:**
    - Write and run automated tests using Node's native test runner (`node --test`).
    - Store tests inside `src/tests/` matching target service or helper boundaries.
4.  **Keep Server Docs Up to Date:**
    - Always update the [`implementation_server.md`](implementation_server.md) file after completing or modifying any API route, database schema, or backend business logic. Scan it first to avoid redundancy.
